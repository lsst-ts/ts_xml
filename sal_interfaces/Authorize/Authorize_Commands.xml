      <Description>Comma seperated list of authorized users currently allowed to command this CSC,

            If the first character is +/- then the specified users are added/removed.
            Duplicates are silently ignored.
            The CSC's own user@host is silently ignored, because it is always authorized.
            For removal, CSCs that are not in the list are silently ignored.
            Whitespace is allowed after the optional initial +/- and after each comma.
